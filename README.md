# NetCoreWithReactRedux
A working project template for ReactJS with redux single page application.
The existing ReactRedux dotnet template provided by Microsoft is featuring typescript instead of javascript (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/spa/react-with-redux?view=aspnetcore-2.2).
This project  provides a working template that contains: 
- reactjs
- redux
- thunk
- reactstrap
hooked up and ready to go.

This project contains examples for multiple common use-cases for redux:
- Input text box
- Increment counter (sync and async)
- Fetch data from REST Api.

This project runs a SPA served by a .net core 2.1 server (static files).
To run the project you will need to download
```
git clone https://github.com/mattan212/NetCoreWithReactRedux.git
```
Open in Visual Studio, build, and run.
